> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Give Credits Where its Due**
> 
> Alot of the inspiration for this code is from the [Python Discord Bot Template](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template) by [kkrypt0nn](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn). Please check out their repo for more information. I have made many changes to the code and havent explicitly stated in every file, that why I have thought it would be best to keep it at the top of the README.md file.

> [!NOTE]
> **New Project**
> 
> This project is still in the making!!! I would appreciate if you gave this repo a star, that would mean a lot to me!
